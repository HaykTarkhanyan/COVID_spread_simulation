# COVID_spread_simulation
Thats toy simulation of how a virus spreads.

Since writing argparser is boring, you will need to open main.py, change globals and enjoy the simulation.

We start with a board of given size, and given days when should there start an emenrgancy, when will virus start deepening etc(detatils in code)
